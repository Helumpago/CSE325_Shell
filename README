Introduction:
	The goal of this project is to create a basic shell.  It will be capable of executing in two modes: Interactive and batch mode. Commands will also be able to be run in parallel.

Usage:
	There are 2 ways of using our shell: interactive and batch.
		Interactive:
			./shell
		Batch:
			./shell [batchfile]

	Commands to the shell are formated as follows:
		[bash command] [args]
	Execute commands in parallel:
		[bash command] [args] ; [bash command] [args] ...

	Note: commands in files are formated in the same way. Each line is executed sequentially. 

Testing:
	We ran the included "batch" file to test the shell. This included bad commands, good commands, and multipile commands on 1 line.

	Note: in batch mode it is working as expected that sometimes the command name is printed seperately from the command output due to threading.
